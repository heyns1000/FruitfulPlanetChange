# 🐍👁️ ZERO-WASTE COLLAPSE THEORY (Z-WCT) MONITORING

## Overview

The Zero-Waste Collapse Theory (Z-WCT) monitoring system provides comprehensive threat detection and early warning capabilities across all Airshow Loyalty Protocol principles. This system ensures the integrity and security of TRUTH, BEAUTY, and CURIOSITY deployments.

## Core Philosophy

> "I looks beyond the trunk were no one can see for snakes." 🐍👁️

Z-WCT embodies the principle of proactive vigilance—monitoring not just obvious threats, but hidden vulnerabilities that exist "beyond the trunk" where conventional security measures may not reach.

---

## Threat Detection Layers

### Layer 1: Surface Monitoring

**Scope:** Visible, immediate threats

- Direct attacks on endpoints
- Known vulnerability exploits
- Rate limiting violations
- Authentication failures

### Layer 2: Structural Integrity

**Scope:** System architecture vulnerabilities

- API abuse patterns
- Database injection attempts
- Session hijacking attempts
- CSRF attack vectors

### Layer 3: Beyond the Trunk 🐍

**Scope:** Hidden, sophisticated threats

- Timing attacks on PulseGlow™ synchronization
- Subtle UI manipulation attempts
- Animation timing exploits
- Color injection in principle banners
- SVG rendering vulnerabilities

---

## Principle-Specific Monitoring

- Accessibility compliance scanning

**Alert Threshold:** 99.5% confidence for non-critical, 99.9% for critical visual exploits

**Specific Beauty Threats:**

#### 1. Color Injection Attacks

**Description:** Attempt to inject unapproved colors into Beauty principle palette
**Detection:** CSS parser validates against whitelist: #FF69B4, #B76E79, #FFB6C1, #C71585, #FFC0CB
**Mitigation:** Style sanitization, CSP enforcement

#### 2. Animation Timing Exploits

**Description:** Manipulation of PulseGlow™ timing to cause client-side DoS
**Detection:** Timing analysis with ±10ms tolerance on 0.9s cycle
**Mitigation:** Animation rate limiting, timing validation

#### 3. Flyer Spawn Rate Abuse

**Description:** Triggering excessive flyer generation to exhaust client resources
**Detection:** Monitor spawn rate (max 200ms intervals), memory usage (<50MB)
**Mitigation:** Spawn throttling, automatic cascade pause

#### 4. SVG Rendering Vulnerabilities

**Description:** Malicious SVG payloads targeting rendering engine
**Detection:** SVG sanitization, tag whitelist validation
**Mitigation:** Server-side SVG processing, sandboxed rendering

### CURIOSITY Principle (Batch 3) 🔬

**Status:** PENDING - Monitoring configuration will activate upon deployment
**Anticipated Threat Vectors:**

- Data mining abuse
- Query injection
- Curiosity cascade overflow
- Research result manipulation

## Rhino Strike Early Warning System

### What is Rhino Strike?

A catastrophic threat event where multiple attack vectors converge simultaneously, similar to a charging rhinoceros—powerful, sudden, and difficult to stop once in motion.

### Detection Criteria

A Rhino Strike warning is triggered when:

1. **3+ simultaneous threat vectors** detected across different principles
2. **Attack velocity** exceeds 100 events/second
3. **Cross-principle coordination** patterns identified
4. **Timing synchronization** with PulseGlow™ cycle (potential exploit)

### Warning Levels

#### 🟢 GREEN - Normal Operations

- 0-5 minor threats per hour
- All systems nominal
- PulseGlow™ synchronized across principles
- Memory usage within limits

#### 🟡 YELLOW - Elevated Vigilance

- 6-20 minor threats per hour
- 1 moderate threat detected
- Slight timing anomalies (<50ms variance)
- Increased monitoring frequency activated

#### 🟠 ORANGE - High Alert

- 20+ threats per hour
- 2+ moderate threats or 1 severe threat
- Timing anomalies (>50ms variance)
- Automated defensive measures activated
- Human operator notified

#### 🔴 RED - Rhino Strike Imminent

- 50+ threats per minute
- 3+ severe threats across multiple principles
- Cross-principle attack coordination detected
- All automated defenses engaged
- Emergency protocols activated
- FAAC Architect 4.5.1 authorization required for countermeasures
