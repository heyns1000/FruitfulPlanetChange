## Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application, using React for the frontend and Express for the backend, designed as a comprehensive brand management portal for the "Fruitful Global" ecosystem.

The project aims to provide a robust platform for global brand management, featuring comprehensive data synchronization, real-time analytics, and advanced integration capabilities for various business functions.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Repository/Project Organization: User maintains systematic repository setup for ecosystem projects with limited scope focused on core ecosystem data (prime time data for comprehensive vision consolidation).

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure, separating client, server, and shared components.

**Core Architectural Decisions:**
- **Monorepo Structure**: Clear separation between client, server, and shared components.
- **Data-Driven**: All dashboard statistics, pricing, and system metrics are sourced from the PostgreSQL database, eliminating hardcoded data.
- **Modularity**: Components and services are designed for reusability and clear separation of concerns.
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling and various deployment environments.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite for build tooling, Wouter for routing, shadcn/ui on Radix UI for UI components, Tailwind CSS for styling, and TanStack React Query for server state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM, RESTful API design with JSON responses, and Express sessions for session management.
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive entities for Users, Sectors, Brands, System Status, Legal Documents, Repositories, and Payments. Includes specific structures for OmniGrid™ FAA.zone™ Infrastructure (PulseTrade™ Sectors, Atom-Level Engines, Vault Terminals, Admin Portal, Real-time Monitoring) and SecureSign™ Infrastructure (Legal Documents, NDA Records, API Keys, Document Templates, Audit Trail).
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Professional gradient-styled modals, micro-interaction design system using framer-motion for smooth animations and interactive feedback, comprehensive dashboard layouts (including Schumacher sales-focused template), and dynamic icon systems.
